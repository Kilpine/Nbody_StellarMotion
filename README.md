# Nbody_StellarMotion
This code allows users to create a small scale nbody simulation of stars motion.  The code allows users to put in the initial conditions of the stars (positions, velocities) and then calculates their motion throughout a set timescale. This data is plotted in three separated plots: 2D X v. Y, 2D X v. Z, and a 3D plot.
