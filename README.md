# Introduction
This code allows users to create a small scale nbody simulation of stars motion.  The code allows users to put in the initial conditions of the stars (positions, velocities) and then calculates their motion throughout a set timescale. This data is plotted in three separated plots: 2D X v. Y, 2D X v. Z, and a 3D plot. 

# Notes 
The code has been updated with a new file called 'StellarMotionCode_2.py'. This version of the code allows for plotting at set intervals. It also plots out the totsal energy of the system.
